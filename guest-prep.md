## Thank you so much for coming on as a guest to Coherence Time.

I'll be streaming the show from [my Twitch account](https://www.twitch.tv/crazy4pi314) every Friday at 3pm PDT (other times may be used to accomodate timezones of participants).

Streamed shows will be recorded and posted on [YouTube](http://youtube.com/SarahKaiser314).

The goal of the show is to try to recreate the "hallway track" experience of Quantum conferences now that we're not able to catch up in person. There's no set agenda. We can talk about how you've been doing over the past few months, cover projects you'd like to share, and go through any news and announcements. We'll also be taking questions from the audience and keeping an eye on the live chatroom to ensure an interactive experience for viewers.

Please feel free to reach out with questions to sckaiser@sckaiser.com.
